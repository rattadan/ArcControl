# ARC Control

A native Android/iOS application showcasing multi-chain crypto functionality (ArcEVM, Solana, Noble and all supported CCTP enabled networks) and an interactive price chart with technical indicators and AI insights. The app integrates on-chain data (balances, transfers/bridging) and a candlestick chart that can fetch OHLCV data, compute indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA), and render AI-generated annotations on top of the chart.

You can easily check all USDC/EURC balances across all networks and shift it around with a single tap
Furthermore you can use the integrated Chart to investigate pricechart along with an easy-to-use UI and Akash powered Chart Insights
